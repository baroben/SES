Encapsulation : 
 - object composed of data members and function members
 - data members = properties of the object & function members = operations on the object

Data hiding :
WHAT ? 
- Data members are only manipulated with the function members (functions are the tools)
- Data members are hidden from the outside

WHY ? 
- Make sure that the object integrity is preserved, internal state (combination of all the data members) remains valid at all times
-The user can't modificate the variable members without respecting the rules imposed by the function members
- Reduces the coupling btw a class and the code
- We can change ALL the internal state and it's behavior, it won't affect the code if the interface isn't change (ie the name of the function)

Constructors :
- Default constructor doesn't have any parameters
- If data members aren't initialize, they contain random values
- Use member initializer list in priority
- Constructors and function defined inside the class are inline (function code is paste directly inside the code)
- Box() = default; is the best way to define a default constructor
